## How to Use This Roadmap

The purpose of this roadmap is to introduce you to the key concepts and provide a broad understanding of the various components that make up the field of data engineering. It is important to understand that you do not need to master every technology listed. Instead, use this roadmap as a guide to navigate your professional career path in data engineering.

## Focus on Concepts

Throughout the roadmap, you will find various sections dedicated to different technologies, methodologies, and tools. For instance, in the section on object storage, we have included technologies such as Ceph, MinIO, and Amazon S3. While each of these technologies has its unique features and advantages, the primary objective is for you to grasp the concept of object storage itself. Once you have a solid understanding of this concept, you can then choose a specific technology to focus on based on your data architecture requirements or the preferences of your organization.

## Understanding the Color Codes

To help you navigate the roadmap more effectively, we have used a color-coded legend to annotate different topics:

- **Purple**: Personal Recommendation / Opinion
- **Green**: Alternative Option - Pick this or purple
- **Gray**: Order in roadmap not strict (Learn anytime)
- **Blue**: Cloud

These colors reflect the personal recommendations and common tools suggested by the contributors of the roadmap, all of whom have over five years of experience in the field. It is crucial to note that these recommendations are not mandatory. The recommended tools not only rely on expert opinions and industry practices but also enjoy widespread community acceptance. They are widely used by the data engineering community and have excellent community support.

## Selective Learning

The roadmap is designed to be a starting point, offering insights that will help you make informed decisions. The listed technologies are diverse and extensive, making it impractical to delve deeply into each one. Therefore, we emphasize that understanding the core concepts is far more crucial than getting bogged down by the plethora of tools available. Select the tools and technologies that best align with your goals and organizational needs.

## Your Professional Growth

We hope that this roadmap will serve as a valuable resource, guiding you towards making informed decisions and building a strong foundation in data engineering. Use it to explore new areas, reinforce your knowledge, and advance your skills in this dynamic field.
